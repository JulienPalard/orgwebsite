* Org-mode talk at the Max-Planck Institute for Neurology

There a video of the Org-mode talk at the Max-Planck Institute for
Neurological Research about [[http://orgmode.org][Org-mode]] that I (Carsten Dominik) gave on
February 8, 2010.  Thanks to Stefan Vollmar for his invitation and
hospitality during the visit.  The video is available for download [[http://www.nf.mpg.de/orgmode/guest-talk-dominik.html][here]].

For projection purposes you can also download the slides as a [[file:MPI-Neurology-Talk-Org-mode.pdf][PDF
file]].  If you'd like to prepare your own talk about Org-mode and want
to use some of my slides, here is the [[file:MPI-Neurology-Talk-Org-mode-keynote.zip][Apple keynote]] version of the
talk.  I am making all these files available under the [[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/][creative
