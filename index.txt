Org - an Emacs Mode for Notes and Project Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Org-mode is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining ToDo lists, and doing
project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

Org-mode develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that contain
information about projects as plain text.  Org-mode is implemented on
top of outline-mode, which makes it possible to keep the content of
large files well structured.  Visibility cycling and structure editing
help to work with the tree.  Tables are easily created with a built-in
table editor.  Org-mode supports ToDo items, deadlines, time stamps,
and scheduling.  It dynamically compiles entries into an agenda.
Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails, Usenet
messages, BBDB entries, and any files related to the projects.  For
printing and sharing of notes, an Org-mode file can be exported as a
structured ASCII file, or as HTML.

Current Version
===============

The current version is 4.74.  To see what has changed in recent
releases, check this [list of user-visible changes].

Compatibility
=============

This package works on Emacs 21 and (with minor restrictions) on
XEmacs 21.  Version 4.67c will be part of the Emacs 22.1 release.

 *Attention XEmacs users*: Starting with Org-mode 4.38, Org-mode will
only work correctly with XEmacs if you use [noutline.el], a new
implementation of outline-mode.  Until this package becomes part of
XEmacs, you can find it in the xemacs subdirectory of the Org-mode
distribution.  Just compile it and place it onto you load path,
Org-mode will load it automatically.

Downloads
=========

* Distribution
  Download as [zip file] or [gzipped tar archive].  These archives
  contain both the Lisp file org.el and the documentation in PDF 
  and (TeX)Info formats.
  
* Documentation
  - Read the documentation [online].
  - Download the documentation in [PDF], [Info], or [TeXInfo] format.
  - Download the [Refcard] for org-mode.       
  - There is also a [Japanese translation] of the manual (version 4.60), produced by Takeshi Okano.
  

Frequently Asked Questions

The [FAQ] used to be part of the manual but this is no longer the case.

Mailing list

There is a mailing list for discussion about org-mode.  You can
subscribe to it at [this webpage] or directly [send mail to it] (which
will make it to the list after the moderator has accepted it.
Furthermore you can access the mailing list on [Gmane] through a

Tutorials
---------
    - There is a very nice introductory [OrgMode tutorial] by [David O'Toole] covering the basics of TODO lists and the agenda.  It
      has been translated into [French], [Japanese], [Chinese], and [Korean].

Org-mode and GTD
----------------
    Org-mode is flexible enough to implement many different ways of
    organizing your projects.  A frequently discusses scheme is [David Allen's] strategy for [Getting Things Done].  Here are a couple of
    links related to this topic.

    - [Charles Cave] has written an [article/tutorial] about the basic
      elements of GTD and how he implements them in Org-mode.

    - There have been several threads on emacs-orgmode@gnu.org related
      to GTD, the most important ones are:
      - [Another GTD question], which contains a discussion about basic
        GTD aspects.  It also contains this
      - [Post by Carsten] summarising several options for implementing
        GTD in org-mode.
      - [GTD, Projects and Next Actions in org-mode] is a thread where
        several people describe their personal setup is 

    - Also on the web you can find information about how people are
      setting up Org-mode to fit their habits.  A few examples:

      - This [blog post] shows a very simple and clear GTD setup.

Add-Ons
-------

    - [Piotr Zielinski] wrote [org-mouse.el] which is now distributed with
      Org-mode. It implements very interesting mouse support for many
      functions in org-mode.

    - [David O'Toole] is the author of [org-publish.el].  While this is
      now part of the Org-mode distribution, you might find the newest
      bug fixes and developments at his [Org-mode page], along with
      several other projects like /org-blog.el/ and
      /org-publish-escript.el/.

    - [Bastien Guerry] has a package for using Org-mode as the basis for
      blogging, it is available at [this page].

  + Translators
    
    I know about the following attempts to translate from and to
    Org-mode files:
    
    - [From Palm TODO database to Orgmode]. This Translator was
      written by [Olaf Dietsche].
    
    - [From Org-mode to remind] by [Bastien Guerry].
    

Future Development
------------------
    - Here is a [list of ideas] that are still to be processed somehow,
      when I get to it.
