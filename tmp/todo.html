<h2 id="sec-1">1 Introduction</h2>


<p>
This is a loose collection of ideas and TODO items for the future
development of Org-mode.  These ideas come from various sources,
mostly from emacs-orgmode@gnu.org, from direct emails to me, or from
my own day-dreaming.  I don't always mention the source of an idea,
out of laziness.  However, when I implement a good idea, I try to
mention the origin of this idea in the <i>Acknowledgments</i> section of
the manual - let me know if I forgot to give <i>you</i> credit for
something.
</p>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2">1.1 Nomenclature</h3>

<p>On this page, I am using TODO keywords in the following way:
</p><table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<col align="left"></col><col align="left"></col>
<thead>
<tr><th><b>Keyword</b></th><th>Intention</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><b>TODO</b></td><td>A development  that is going to happen, once I have time or once I figure out how to do it.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>IDEA</b></td><td>A new idea, I have not yet decided what if anything I will do about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>WISH</b></td><td>A wish, probably voiced by someone on  emacs-orgmode@gnu.org.  This is less than a new idea, more a change in existing behavior.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>QUESTION</b></td><td>A question someone asked, that needs some thinking before it can be answered</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>DECLINED</b></td><td>I have decided not to implement this feature, but I am keeping it in the list so that people can see it, complain, or still try to convince me.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>INCONSISTENCY</b></td><td>Some behavior in Org-mode that is not as clean and consistent as I would like it to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>BUG</b></td><td>This needs to be fixed, as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>DONE</b></td><td>Well, done is done.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>NEW</i></td><td>This is a tag, indicating recently added entries</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>&lt;50&gt;</td></tr>

<h2 id="sec-3">2 Tasks</h2>



<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4">2.1 Structure</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="todo">TODO</span> Definition lists, like in Muse<br/>
</li>
<li><span class="todo">TODO</span> Get rid of all the \r instances, which were used only for XEmacs.<br/>
</li>
<li><span class="todo">IDEA</span> Should we allow #+TODO as an alias for #+SEQ<sub>TODO</sub>?<br/>
</li>
<li><span class="todo">TODO</span> proper visibility cycling for items<br/>
Make them not hide the text after the final list item.
This is not trivial, we cannot usenormal outline stuff,
needs a separate implementaiton.
</li>
<li><span class="todo">IDEA</span> allow different colors for different TODO keywords/tags.<br/>
</li>
<li><span class="todo">TODO</span> Use an indirect buffer for org-goto.<br/>
Is there a problem with the overriding map?

</li>
<li><span class="todo">WISH</span> Inline TODO entries<br/>
A way to put a TODO entry without starting a new section.

</li>
<li><span class="todo">TODO</span> Speedbar support for agenda.<br/>

</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5">2.2 Agenda issues</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="todo">QUESTION</span> COLUMN View<br/>
is this safe, or could things be messed up with this?
</li>
<li><span class="todo">TODO</span> Make S-right and S-left change TODO keywords<br/>
Right now they change the time stamps.  This could be
M-left/right, but this could also cause inconsistencies, because
when on a time stamp, the same keys do exactly this.
</li>
<li><span class="todo">WISH</span> Make more modes changeable from the agenda<br/>
These could be made available for toggling, just like
follow-mode. Examples:
<ul>
<li>
org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels
</li>
<li>
org-tags-match-list-sublevels
</li>
<li>
org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="todo">IDEA</span> Sort TODO entries according to type?<br/>
This would apply for the list collection, not in the day entries.
However, I could also have a TODO keyword criterion that could be
used in the day entries, as one of the minor criteria.

</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> Allow separators in the Tag-sorted agenda view<br/>
This feature is not going to come, because block agendas can
achieve the same thing.


</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6">2.3 Links</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="todo">WISH</span> When editing links, give access to stored links.<br/>
Not sure why this is needed.
Idea from William Henney.
</li>
<li><span class="todo">WISH</span> Variable of standard links for completion with C-c C-l<br/>
Or something like that, to make standard links fast.
</li>
<li><span class="todo">WISH</span> Make brackets in links possible<br/>
Would require a display property also for the label part of
links.
</li>
<li><span class="todo">IDEA</span> Find all links to a specific file<br/>
</li>
<li><span class="todo">IDEA</span> Make info HTML links work for links to Info files<br/>
Info links of course only work inside Emacs.  However, many info
documents are on the web, so the HTML exporter could try to be
smart and convert an Info link into the corresponding link on the
web.  For example, we could use the GNU software site then
Name.HTML.  Here is the link to be used:
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/</a> Another
question is, is this URL going to be stable so that it makes sense
to actually put this into org.el?

</li>
<li><span class="todo">IDEA</span> Make news HTML links work, using Google.<br/>
I can use Google groups with a message id to find a USENET message,
even if the original link points to gnus.

</li>
<li><span class="todo">TODO</span> Remove irretrievable links from <i>published</i> HTML output<br/>
This is on David's table, and he will hopefully integrate a
mechanism for this into org-publish.el.  The discussion about this
was started by <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/281">Austin Frank</a>

</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> Agenda collections, based on #+COLLECTION lines.<br/>
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/139">Tim Callaghan</a> started the discussion on this one.
Declined because this would depend on local variables and the
agenda commands are global.  Also, this can actually be done by
specifying the file list in a custom agenda command.

</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> Make CamelCase words link to corresponding org-mode files.<br/>
Files in the same directory.  Or some other way to easy do that.
Would be useful for publishing projects.  This would be an
incompatible change, but I don't think anyone is using CamelCase
anyway?
This is marked declined, because link abbreviations now provide an
easy way to make links to other files.

</li>
<li><span class="todo">TODO</span> Document the character protection in links<br/>
I don't think this is really covered anywhere.
Maybe we also should protect characters in the visible part, to
make sure thing will never be on two lines&hellip;?
</li>
<li><span class="todo">WISH</span> Radio targets across files<br/>
I guess each org file could write a .orgtargets.filename file, if
it has any radio targets.


</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-7">2.4 <span class="todo">DECLINED</span> Fast update for external editing</h3>

<p>Could I use a dynamic block for this?
</p>

</div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-8">2.5 Tables</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="todo">WISH</span> Row formulas<br/>
@4=&hellip;..
</li>
<li><span class="todo">TODO</span> Write a tutorial<br/>
Demonstrate running averages.

</li>
<li><span class="todo">WISH</span> Make a variable that current line should be recomputed always<br/>
in each table, skipping headers of course.

</li>
<li><span class="todo">TODO</span> Allow a table to locally change the unit system<br/>
This is for using constants.el.
Well, it is now possible to do this for the file, is this enough???
</li>
<li><span class="todo">QUESTION</span> Does inserting hlines change references correctly?<br/>
</li>
<li><span class="todo">WISH</span> Interactive way to get a converted table?<br/>
</li>
<li><span class="todo">BUG</span> When computing in a narrowed column, this may go wrong.<br/>
Computing changes fields and does not yet see correctly if the column
width has changed, in the case of a narrowed column.

</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> Alternative for the implementation of orgtbl-minor-mode:<br/>
I could use post-command-hook to set the variable orgtbl-mode.
I will not do this now and only consider it if problems show up.

</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> Table info lines are not necessarily comments in orgtbl-mode<br/>
Should I generalize this?  No, because the table itself will not be
in the correct syntax for whatever mode.

</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> S-cursor motion to select part of a table, with proper highlighting.<br/>
Similar to CUA


</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-9">2.6 Properties and Column View</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="todo">TODO</span> Mouse support for selecting values<br/>
This could/should be part of org-mouse.el.
<ul>
<li>
<b>[<span style="visibility:hidden;">X</span>]</b> tags
</li>
<li>
<b>[<span style="visibility:hidden;">X</span>]</b> todo

<li><span class="todo">BUG</span> We have no clear view on what to do with properties upon export.<br/>


</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-10">2.7 Compatibility issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>Emacs 21 compatibility<br/>
This is being phased out.  Almost everything works under Emacs 21,
but in the future I will make little effort to support it.
<ul>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> Column view does not yet work for Emacs 21s.<br/>
Declined, because I don't know how to do this.  Too many
problems.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>XEmacs compatibility<br/>
<ul>
<li><span class="todo">QUESTION</span> Is there an issue with the coding system of HTML exported files?<br/>
In the code I used to have a comment saying that
<pre>
  (and (fboundp 'coding-system-get)
       (boundp 'buffer-file-coding-system)
                 buffer-file-coding-system))
</pre>
always returns nil, implicating that setting the coding system for
the export buffer would not work correctly.  however, I have never
followed up on this and never had a bug report - so I am wondering
if there is an issue at all.

</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> Column view does not yet work for XEmacs.<br/>
Declined, because I don't know how to do this.  Too many
problems.
</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> Rewrite the `format' function<br/>
To make narrowing work under XEmacs, I would need to write a
version of <i>format</i> that does transport text properties, or I
would have to rework narrowing entirely.  Unlikely that this will
happen, mainly because it is working in Emacs and so does not
bother me personally so much.  Anyway, I don't know if people are
actually using narrowing very much at all.


</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-11">2.8 Exporting</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="todo">IDEA</span> Convert links to footnotes for ASCII export.<br/>
</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> Store LaTeX code as HTML comments<br/>
Declined because I don't really see the need for this.
</li>
<li><span class="todo">IDEA</span> Microformats<br/>
Nic Ferrier has been pushing this agenda for a long time, for
example with <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/140/">this email</a>.  I am not deep enough into the semantic
web that I could do this myself.  Maybe we can do this by
modifying the html exporter step-by-step?
</li>
<li><span class="todo">INCONSISTENCY</span> Find a better place for formatting checkboxes<br/>
Right now this is being done as part of `org-html-expand', which
does not seem logically correct.
</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> Can I make the exporter more efficient?<br/>
The line-by-line processing may not be the fastest way to do
this.  It certainly uses more resources.  Right now the exporters
do work though, so it is unlikely that I am going to change this.

</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> CSV import/export of tables?<br/>
I remember this coming up several times, for example in emails
from <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/156">Niels Giesen</a> and <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/139">Tim Callaghan</a>.  Org-mode does have
Tab-separated export of tables, so right now I don't really see
the benefit of adding CSV export.  Are there applications that do
not understand tab-separated files, but do understand
comma-separated ones?

</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> In HTML export, make links from the time stamps<br/>
Time stamps have their own class now which allows to highlight
them etc.  But I was wondering if something more useful could be
done with them, like a link to some kind of calendar&hellip;



</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-12">2.9 Miscellaneous Stuff</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="todo">TODO</span> reinstating a repeated item: keyword for logging.<br/>
</li>
<li><span class="todo">BUG</span> Comments cannot be filled<br/>
</li>
<li><span class="todo">IDEA</span> New uses for C-c C-c<br/>
<ul>
<li>
Compute time interval on time range
</li>
<li>
Update CLOCK interval
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="todo">QUESTION</span> Fix more beginning-of-line commands<br/>
Org-mode re-binds C-a to make this command go to the beginning of
a visible line.  There are other keys which might invoke C-a.
Should these keys be changed as well?  one could use
`substitute-key-definition' on the global map to find them all.
</li>
<li><span class="todo">QUESTION</span> Inlining of images in Org-mode files<br/>
</li>
<li><span class="todo">TODO</span> Fixup outline-magic.el, so that it can be used.<br/>
</li>
<li><span class="todo">TODO</span> Use the new argument of bibtex-url<br/>
Roland Winkler was kind enough to implement a new argument to the
`bibtex-url' command that allows me to retrieve the corresponding
URL, whether it is taken from a URL field or constructed in some
clever way.  Currently I am not using this, because too many
people use an old Emacs version which does not have this.
however, eventually I will implement this.
</li>
<li><span class="todo">WISH</span> Get people to write articles about how to do GTD with Org-mode.<br/>
There is now one by Charles Cave, read it <a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/orgmode.html">here</a>

</li>
<li><span class="todo">IDEA</span> Tree statistics<br/>
A key that can be applied to a tree, showing statistics:
<ul>
<li>
how many headlines
</li>
<li>
how many TODO
</li>
<li>
how many DONE
</li>
<li>
Checkboxes
</li>
<li>
etc&hellip;.

</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="todo">QUESTION</span> Do we need a 43 folders implementation?<br/>
That could easily be done in an org-mode file.  But then, maybe
this should really be a paper thing. 

</li>
<li>Priorities<br/>
Here is some information about priorities, which is not yet
documented.
<ul>
<li> Priorities<br/>
<pre>    TODO entries: 1 or 1,2,...
    DEADLINE is 10-ddays, i.e. it is 10 on the due day
                          i.e. it goes above top todo stuff 7 days
                               before due
    SCHEDULED is 5-ddays, i.e. it is 5 on the due date
                          i.e. it goes above top todo on the due day
    TIMESTAMP is 0        i.e. always at bottom
                          but as a deadline it is 100
                          but if scheduled it is 99
    TIMERANGE is 0        i.e. always at bottom
    DIARY is 0            i.e. always at bottom

    Priority * 1000

</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="todo">INCONSISTENCY</span>: items don't grow/shrink due to promotion.<br/>
In plain lists, multiple demote/promote commands executed directly
after each other don't change the scope of the command - the
initially selected text continues to be selected.  This is
inconsistent with the behavior of outline sections, were the subtree
for promotion/demotion is newly defined after each command.  Which
convention is better?  Should this be consistent between trees and
plain lists?

</li>
<li><span class="todo">INCONSISTENCY</span>: M-TAB does not work on plain lists.  Why???<br/>

</li>
<li><span class="todo">QUESTION</span> grep on directory does not yet work.<br/>
I am actually not sure, I might have addressed this already, but
my memory is failing me.  Needs some checking.

</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> HAVE a TIME 3:55 line collecting CLOCK results<br/>
The CLOCK lines could be there in addition, or could even be
removed, so that only one line is kept.
</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> Think about Piotr's idea of treating TODO like a TAG.<br/>
The answer is probably NO because the simple part of TODO must
still be there and I like the keyword at the beginning of the line,
just like a checkbox.  Of course you can make a TODO tag yourself
at any time.

</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> Inlining of external files<br/>

</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> Should TAB on TODO keyword rotate its state?<br/>
Problem:  If the keyword disappears, it will suddenly start to fold&hellip;.
So my feeling right now is that the answer should be NO.

<p>
No, because S-left/right does this already pretty well
</p>
</li>
<li><span class="todo">DECLINED</span> Create a DONE counter in the mode line<br/>
That counter shows what faction of entries has been marked DONE.  I
am not yet sure how useful such a thing would be, because of the
huge number of entries that can be in a file, and the different
weight of such entries.
Declined because we do now have counters for checkboxes, and the
feeling is that this is not so useful for TODOs.

<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-06-01 Thu 09:17</span>) Remove date stamps from headline if they are not needed.<br/>
Bug report from Scott.


</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-06-01 Thu 09:17</span>) : Maybe s-up/down should change priorities only in headlines<br/>
Right now this works wherever the cursor is.  If this is changed,
should S-up or S-down do something else?  

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-06-01 Thu 09:21</span>) Need a command to remove tabulators from a line.<br/>
Use this in ASCII export, to make sure we get the indentation
right.

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-06-01 Thu 09:24</span>) Improve tab in org-cycle:<br/>
<ul>
<li>
there is a bug when the setting is 'white:  It requires a
non-empty white line!
</li>
<li>
There should be another setting to have tab be the tabulator in
the white space at the beginning of the line.
</li>
<li>
Finally, when TAB closes an entry, maybe it should go beck to the
beginning of the entry???  On the other hand, it is good to be
able to go back to the old place with just another tab.

</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-06-01 Thu 11:48</span>) Include TAGS into sorting.<br/>
But what strategy should be used when there are several tags?

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-06-06 Tue 10:15</span>) Archiving an entry in current buffer goes to end of file<br/>
Should go to end of subtree.
This is done now, and I also control the amount of empty lines
created by the archiving process in general.

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-06-06 Tue 10:16</span>) Narrowing agenda to current files does not work as advertized.<br/>
C-c a 1 t should make the TODO list for the current file, but does
not.

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-06-06 Tue 10:17</span>) Radio TAGS for the fast tag interface.<br/>
Make lists of tags that are mutually exclusive.  So when I turn on
@HOME, @WORK would be turned off automagically.  A good syntax for
defining these groups in the #+TAGS line would be:
<pre>
 #+TAGS: [@WORK(w) @HOME(h) @CLUB(c)] Laptop(l) PC(p) Car(r)
</pre>
This could indicate that @WORK, @HOME, @CLUB are mutually exclusive.

<p>
If I do this, I will also need a syntax for the global alist to
indicate the same thing.
</p>
<p>
It seems to me that with such grouping of tags, sorting would be
useful as it would improve the overview over the current tags.  I
might even be able to support mutually exclusive tags with
fontification in the interface.  Or arrange things such that the
mutually exclusive ones are all in the same row or column, to
optimize the visual feedback.
</p>
<p>
For the internal format, I think best would be something like
</p>
<p>
<pre>
 '( (:startgroup) ("@work") ("@home") ("@club") (:endgroup)
    ("Laptop") ("PC") ("Car"))
</pre>
This setup makes sure that assoc and rassoc still do work as
expected.
</p>
</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-06-06 Tue 10:17</span>) Should tags be sorted in a certain way?<br/>
Right now, you can either set the tag sequence yourself through
the completion interface.  If you use the fast tag selection
interface, the tag sequence depends on the order in which tags are
selected and deselected.  maybe a specific roder would be useful
for example the same order as the one given in the configuration?

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-06-06 Tue 10:17</span>) Remove narrowing cookies for export<br/>
Exported tables should not show narrowing cookies.  In fact, if a
table line does contain nothing but narrowing cookies, the entire
line should be removed.

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-06-11 Sun 07:32</span>) Track working times similar to time-clock.el<br/>
This was proposed by David O'Toole in an
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/387">email to emacs-orgmode@gnu.org</a>.  He wants to be able to know the
times when he worked at a particular project.  Some reporting
possibility would be needed to make this useful.  Maybe sparse
trees with broken-down working times?

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-06-15 Thu 13:35</span>) Make org-store-link do better in image-mode buffers<br/>
Just link to the file.

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-06-15 Thu 13:35</span>) Use a ported version of noutline.el<br/>
Programming the old outline-mode is really a nightmare - the new
outline mode that uses invisibility properties instead of
selective display works really much much better.  There is now
an <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/214/focus=218">experimental port</a> by Greg Chernov, so when I find time I will
try if this works well.  If yes, this port should become part of
XEmacs.  Once that happens, I could remove a large amount of
ballast from org.el

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-06-15 Thu 13:35</span>) Verify links during export<br/>

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-09-25 Mon 16:11</span>) Allow counting checkboxes<br/>
Then some statistics should be displayed.  One idea is for
checkboxes, to use a special box [%] which will be updated with
percent of done.  I could have an alternative [/] that will be
updated with something like [19/25] to show progress, and when the
two numbers are equal, I could highlight then in DONE face, just
like [100%].  All smaller numbers could be highlighted even in
TODO face if I wanted.  Hmmm, I am beginning to like this.

<p>
Then: how to update this?  Each time a checkbox is added or
toggled, go up and update all the counts, right up to something
which is not an item, or up to the previous header line.
</p>
<p>
Maybe I should also make an option for turning this on, to avoid
slowdown.  I guess for long lists this could be slow.
</p>
<p>
Also would need a command for global update.
</p>
<p>
An maybe plain list and checkboxes should get their own chapter?
In Structure they seem to be a bit hidden&hellip;..
</p>
<p>
Also a menu sublist&hellip;

<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-09-25 Mon 16:11</span>) Allow stacking calls to org-occur<br/>
This was a proposal from Piotr.  It is now possible, the second
and subsequent calls to org-occur need a prefix argument to keep
the previous highlights.

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-09-25 Mon 16:12</span>) Fixup tag display in agenda buffer.<br/>
The tabs mess up everything.  Either remove the tabs, or realign
the tags to some useful column.

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-09-25 Mon 16:12</span>) Blocks in agenda:<br/>
Make a single agenda buffer that contains several sets of items,
like the TODO list, a tags list, and a day view.  Not a bad idea.
This was <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/167/focus=168">Piotr's idea</a>.

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2006-09-25 Mon 16:12</span>) Make org-store-link do the right thing in dired-mode<br/>

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2007-01-24 Wed 13:07</span>) Need a command to do show hierarchy after isearch.<br/>
Maybe automatically, using isearch-mode-end-hook.  But this does
not seem to work, because to is called before the overlays are
re-installed.  I can create a new hook, isearch-exit-hook, run in
`isearch-exit'.

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2007-02-18 Sun 07:16</span>) hook for users to do their own agenda lists<br/>
New function dumping headline into the agenda buffer, based on regexp
and callback, to allow general stuff.  For the special tags, we can
search for one and check for the others using the callback.

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2007-02-18 Sun 07:37</span>) Make C-c C-l also work on a plain link, converting it into bracket.<br/>

<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2007-02-18 Sun 07:37</span>) GNUS <i>&lt;gnus:mail.general#123&gt;</i> stuff should be "Email from:&hellip;"<br/>

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2007-02-18 Sun 07:38</span>) Email/message context:  What format?<br/>
I can think of two good formats for this:
<pre>
 Email from John Smith   (if I an the receiver)
 Email to John Smith     (if I am the author)
</pre>
or
<pre>
 John Smith on: Some subject     (this is the current Org-mode default.)
</pre>
The first format requires better parsing of the messages (to get
both author and receiver names), and also
some way to detect if I am the author of this email or not.

<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2007-02-21 Wed 12:04</span>) Allow internal links to match inside <b>other</b> link<br/>

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2007-02-21 Wed 12:07</span>) Allow fully protected HTML code that will be exported as is<br/>
Currently, <&hellip;> works only for simple tags, and I think we
should have something better.  Idea:  Text between &lt;protecthtml&gt;
and &lt;/protecthtml&gt;, mark it with a text property and then exclude
each match in the run preparing the export.
I guess I could require these at the beginning of the line, like



<p>
or something like that&hellip;&hellip;.
</p>
</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2007-03-13 Tue 05:19</span>) Make it possible to set TOC levels independently of headline levels<br/>
The easiest way to do this would obviously be to allow a number
setting for the tco switch, not only a simple t/nil switch.  This
can be nice for webpages:  One could have only top-level or level
1 and 2 in the toc at the beginning of the page, and then still a
more complex structure below.

</li>
<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2007-03-13 Tue 05:20</span>) Filling is not done in a compatible way.<br/>
The current setup used the Emacs variables and machine to get the
filling of plain lists and everything lese right.  XEmacs uses the
filladapt package, which has different ways to do the same
things.  org.el should be smart about this and setup filling under
XEmacs correctly.

<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/149">Dieter Grollman</a> requested this feature, but for now I have decided
not to do anything about it.  I don't see a good way to implement

such tasks.

<li><span class="done">DONE</span>( <span class="timestamp">2007-06-14 Thu 13:20</span>) Conflict between bold emphasis and headlines<br/>
At the beginning of a line, Org-mode does not know if <b>bold</b> is a
headline or an emphasis.  This will not be easy to fix.  The way
to do ii is to require a space after the star in headlines.  This
requires to change outline-regexp, outline-level, the many many
times when outline regexp is used in the program, and also the
countless times when I am simply matching th stars directly.
