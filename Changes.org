* Version 8.0

  This page list changes from the *development version* of Org-mode.
  Changes against the latest stable version are [[file:Changes_old.org][here]].

/This version is only a draft.  It will be completed when Org 8.0 will be
released./

** Installation

   Installation instructions have been updated and simplified.
   
   If you have troubles installing or updating Org, focus on these
   instructions:

   - when updating via a =.zip/.tar.gz= file, you only need to set the
     =load-path= in your =.emacs=.  Set it before any other customization
     that would call autoloaded Org functions.

   - when updating by pulling Org's Git repository, make sure to create the
     correct autoloads.  You can do this by running =~$ make autoloads= (to
     only create the autoloads) or by running =~$ make= (to also compile
     the Elisp files.)  =~$ make help= and =~$ make helpall= can help too.

   - when updating through ELPA (either GNU ELPA or Org ELPA), you have to
     install Org's ELPA package in a session where no Org function has been
     called already.

   When in doubt, run =M-x org-version RET= and see if you have a mixed-up
   installation.
   
   See http://orgmode.org/org.html#Installation for details.

** Incompatible changes

   Org 8.0 is the most disruptive major version of Org.  Users are invited
   to carefully review their customization and maybe to update some aspects
   of their Org files.  When in doubt, ask on the mailing list.

   Below is a list of changes for which an update may be required.
   
   See http://orgmode.org/worg/org-8.0.html for the most recent version of
   this list and for detailed instructions on how to smooth the transition.

**** New export engine
     
     Org 8.0 comes with a new export engine written by Nicolas Goaziou.
     This export engine triggered the rewriting of /all/ export back-ends.

     If you customized the export back-end, you will need to carefully
     review your customization and update it.

**** New syntax for #+ATTR_HTML/LaTeX options

     : #+ATTR_HTML width="200px"

     should now be written

     : #+ATTR_HTML :width 200px

     Keywords like =#+ATTR_HTML= and =#+ATTR_LaTeX= are defined in their
     respective back-ends, and the list of supported parameters depends on
     each backend.  See the Org manual for details.

**** org-remember.el has been removed

     You cannot use remember to capture notes anymore.  Support for
     remember templates has been obsolete since long, it is now fully
     removed.  See FIXME on how to export your remember templates to
     capture templates.

** New packages in core

*** ob-makefile.el by Eric Schulte and Thomas S. Dye

    =ob-makefile.el= implements Org Babel support for Makefile tangling.

*** ox-man.el by Luis Anaya

    =ox-man.el= allows you to export Org files to =man= pages.

*** ox-md.el by Nicolas Goaziou

    =ox-md.el= allows you to export Org files to Markdown files, using the
    vanilla Markdown FIXME syntax.
    
*** ox-texinfo.el by Jonathan Leech-Pepin
    
    =ox-texinfo.el= allows you to export Org files to Texinfo FIXME files.

** New packages in contrib

*** ob-julia.el by G. Jay Kerns

    Julia FIXME is a new programming language.

    =ob-julia.el= provides Org Babel support for evaluating Julia source
    code.

*** ob-mathomatic.el by Luis Anaya

    mathomatic is FIXME

    =ob-mathomatic.el= provides Org Babel support for evaluating mathomatic
    entries.

*** ob-tcl.el by Luis Anaya

    Tcl is FIXME

    =ob-tcl.el= provides Org Babel support for evaluating =Tcl= source
    code.

*** org-bullets.el by Evgeni Sabof
    
    Display bullets instead of stars for headlines.

    Also see this updated FAQ FIXME on how to display another character
    than "*" for starting headlines.

*** org-favtable.el by Marc-Oliver Ihm

    =org-favtable.el= helps you to create and update a table of favorite
    locations in org, keeping the most frequently visited lines right at
    the top.  This table is called "favtable".

    See the documentation on [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-favtable.html][Worg]].

*** ox-confluence.el by SÃ©bastien Delafond

    =ox-confluence.el= lets you convert Org files to Confluence wiki FIXME
    files.

*** ox-deck.el and ox-s5.el by Rick Frankel
    
    [[http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/][deck.js]] is a javascript library for displaying HTML ages as
    presentations.  =ox-deck.el= exports Org files to HTML presentations
    using =deck.js=.

    [[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/][s5]] is a set of scripts which also allows to display HTML pages as
    presentations.  =ox-s5.el= exports Org files to HTML presentations
    using =s5=.

*** ox-koma-letter.el by Nicolas Goaziou and Alan Schmitt

    Export Org pages to the KOMA Scrlttr2 FIXME export back-end, derived
    from the LaTeX export back-end.

*** ox-rss.el by Bastien
    
    Export Org pages to RSS 2.0 feeds.

** Packages moved from core to contrib

Since packages in Org's core are meant to be part of GNU Emacs, we had to
move some contributions into the =contrib/= directory.

The rational for deciding that these files should live in =contrib/= was
either because they rely on third-part softwares that are not included in
Emacs, or because they are not targetting a significant user-base.

*** org-colview-xemacs.el (was in core)

    =org-colview-xemacs.el= implements supports for column view in XEmacs.
    XEmacs users should now load this file from the =contrib/= directory.

*** org-mew.el enhanced by Tokuya Kameshima (was in core)
    
    =org-mew.el= implements support for links to the [[http://www.mew.org][Mew]] mail client.  The
    version included in 8.0 has been enhanced.
    
*** org-w3m.el (was in core)

    To enable support for links to w3m FIXME buffers, load =org-w3m.el= through
    the =org-modules= option.

*** org-wl.el (was in core)

    To enable support for links to Wanderlust FIXME buffers, load
    =org-wl.el= through the =org-modules= option.

*** ox-freedmind.el by Jambunathan (was org-freemind.el in core)

    =ox-freedmind.el= is a rewrite of the org-freemind.el exporter, which
    was originally written by Lennart Borgman.  =ox-freedmind.el= is not
    part of Org's core anymore.

*** ox-taskjuggler.el rewritten by Nicolas Goaziou (was in core)
    
    =ox-taskjuggler.el= is a rewrite of =org-taskjuggler.el=, which was
    originally written by Christian Egli.  This export back-end now targets
    TJ3 by default.  John Hendy wrote [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-taskjuggler3.html][a tutorial on Worg]] for the TJ3
    export.

** New features

# syntaxe des attributs
# completion sur les mots clefs

*** Tags

Using =#+TAGS: { Tag1 : Tag2 Tag3 }= will define =Tag1= as a "group tag"
(note the colon after =Tag1=).  If you search for =Tag1=, it will return
headlines containing either Tag1, Tag2 or Tag3.

You can use group tags for sparse tree in an Org buffer, for creating
agenda views, and for filtering.

** Outside Org

: Two new libraries ('poporg' by FranÃ§ois Pinard and 'outorg' by Thorsten
: Jolitz) now enable editing of comment-sections from source-code buffers
: in temporary Org-mode buffers, making the full editing power of Org-mode
: available. 'outorg' comes together with 'outshine' and 'navi-mode', two
: more libraries by Thorsten Jolitz with the goal to give source-code
: buffers the 'look & feel' of Org-mode buffers while greatly improving
: navigation and structure editing. A detailed description can be found
: here: http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-outside-org.html
