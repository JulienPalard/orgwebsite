#+TITLE:     The Org-mode TODO list

* Introduction

This is a loose collection of ideas and TODO items for the future
development of Org-mode.  These ideas come from various sources,
mostly from emacs-orgmode@gnu.org, from direct emails to me, or from
my own day-dreaming.  I don't always mention the source of an idea,
out of laziness.  However, when I implement a good idea, I try to
mention the origin of this idea in the /Acknowledgments/ section of
the manual - let me know if I forgot to give /you/ credit for
something.

** Nomenclature
   On this page, I am using TODO keywords in the following way:
   |-----------------+----------------------------------------------------|
   | *Keyword*       | Intention                                          |
   |-----------------+----------------------------------------------------|
   | *TODO*          | A development  that is going to happen, once I have time or once I figure out how to do it. |
   | *IDEA*          | A new idea, I have not yet decided what if anything I will do about it. |
   | *WISH*          | A wish, probably voiced by someone on  emacs-orgmode@gnu.org.  This is less than a new idea, more a change in existing behavior. |
   | *QUESTION*      | A question someone asked, that needs some thinking before it can be answered |
   | *DECLINED*      | I have decided not to implement this feature, but I am keeping it in the list so that people can see it, complain, or still try to convince me. |
   | *INCONSISTENCY* | Some behavior in Org-mode that is not as clean and consistent as I would like it to be. |
   | *BUG*           | This needs to be fixed, as soon as possible.       |
   | *DONE*          | Well, done is done.                                |
   | /NEW/           | This is a tag, indicating recently added entries   |
   |                 | <50>                                               |
   |-----------------+----------------------------------------------------|

   
* Tasks

** Structure
*** TODO Definition lists, like in Muse
*** TODO Get rid of all the \r instances, which were used only for XEmacs.
*** IDEA Should we allow #+TODO as an alias for #+SEQ_TODO?
*** TODO proper visibility cycling for items
    Make them not hide the text after the final list item.
    This is not trivial, we cannot usenormal outline stuff,
    needs a separate implementaiton.
*** IDEA allow different colors for different TODO keywords/tags.
*** TODO Use an indirect buffer for org-goto.
    Is there a problem with the overriding map?

*** WISH Inline TODO entries
    A way to put a TODO entry without starting a new section.

*** TODO Speedbar support for agenda.

** Agenda issues
*** QUESTION COLUMN View
    is this safe, or could things be messed up with this?
*** TODO Make S-right and S-left change TODO keywords
    Right now they change the time stamps.  This could be
    M-left/right, but this could also cause inconsistencies, because
    when on a time stamp, the same keys do exactly this.
*** WISH Make more modes changeable from the agenda
    These could be made available for toggling, just like
    follow-mode. Examples:
    - org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels
    - org-tags-match-list-sublevels
    - org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled
*** IDEA Sort TODO entries according to type?
    This would apply for the list collection, not in the day entries.
    However, I could also have a TODO keyword criterion that could be
    used in the day entries, as one of the minor criteria.

*** DECLINED Allow separators in the Tag-sorted agenda view
    This feature is not going to come, because block agendas can
    achieve the same thing.


** Links
*** WISH When editing links, give access to stored links.
    Not sure why this is needed.
    Idea from William Henney.
*** WISH Variable of standard links for completion with C-c C-l
    Or something like that, to make standard links fast.
*** WISH Make brackets in links possible
    Would require a display property also for the label part of
    links.
*** IDEA Find all links to a specific file
*** IDEA Make info HTML links work for links to Info files
    Info links of course only work inside Emacs.  However, many info
    documents are on the web, so the HTML exporter could try to be
    smart and convert an Info link into the corresponding link on the
    web.  For example, we could use the GNU software site then
    Name.HTML.  Here is the link to be used:
    http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ Another
    question is, is this URL going to be stable so that it makes sense
    to actually put this into org.el?

*** IDEA Make news HTML links work, using Google.
    I can use Google groups with a message id to find a USENET message,
    even if the original link points to gnus.

*** TODO Remove irretrievable links from /published/ HTML output
    This is on David's table, and he will hopefully integrate a
    mechanism for this into org-publish.el.  The discussion about this
    was started by [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/281][Austin Frank]]

*** DECLINED Agenda collections, based on #+COLLECTION lines.
    [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/139][Tim Callaghan]] started the discussion on this one.
    Declined because this would depend on local variables and the
    agenda commands are global.  Also, this can actually be done by
    specifying the file list in a custom agenda command.

*** DECLINED Make CamelCase words link to corresponding org-mode files.
    Files in the same directory.  Or some other way to easy do that.
    Would be useful for publishing projects.  This would be an
    incompatible change, but I don't think anyone is using CamelCase
    anyway?
    This is marked declined, because link abbreviations now provide an
    easy way to make links to other files.

*** TODO Document the character protection in links
    I don't think this is really covered anywhere.
    Maybe we also should protect characters in the visible part, to
    make sure thing will never be on two lines...?
*** WISH Radio targets across files
    I guess each org file could write a .orgtargets.filename file, if
    it has any radio targets.


** DECLINED Fast update for external editing
   Could I use a dynamic block for this?


** Tables
*** WISH Row formulas
    @4=.....
*** TODO Write a tutorial
    Demonstrate running averages.

*** WISH Make a variable that current line should be recomputed always
   in each table, skipping headers of course.

*** TODO Allow a table to locally change the unit system
    This is for using constants.el.
    Well, it is now possible to do this for the file, is this enough???
*** QUESTION Does inserting hlines change references correctly?
*** WISH Interactive way to get a converted table?
*** BUG When computing in a narrowed column, this may go wrong.
    Computing changes fields and does not yet see correctly if the column
    width has changed, in the case of a narrowed column.

*** DECLINED Alternative for the implementation of orgtbl-minor-mode:
    I could use post-command-hook to set the variable orgtbl-mode.
    I will not do this now and only consider it if problems show up.
    
*** DECLINED Table info lines are not necessarily comments in orgtbl-mode
    Should I generalize this?  No, because the table itself will not be
    in the correct syntax for whatever mode.

*** DECLINED S-cursor motion to select part of a table, with proper highlighting.
    Similar to CUA


** Properties and Column View
*** TODO Mouse support for selecting values
    This could/should be part of org-mouse.el.
    - [ ] tags
    - [ ] todo
    - [ ] priority
    - [ ] allowed values
    - [ ] deadline
    - [ ] scheduled.
*** BUG We have no clear view on what to do with properties upon export.


** Compatibility issues
*** Emacs 21 compatibility
    This is being phased out.  Almost everything works under Emacs 21,
    but in the future I will make little effort to support it.
**** DECLINED Column view does not yet work for Emacs 21s.
     Declined, because I don't know how to do this.  Too many
     problems.
*** XEmacs compatibility
**** QUESTION Is there an issue with the coding system of HTML exported files?
     In the code I used to have a comment saying that
     :  (and (fboundp 'coding-system-get)
     :       (boundp 'buffer-file-coding-system)
     :                 buffer-file-coding-system))
     always returns nil, implicating that setting the coding system for
     the export buffer would not work correctly.  however, I have never
     followed up on this and never had a bug report - so I am wondering
     if there is an issue at all.
  
**** DECLINED Column view does not yet work for XEmacs.
     Declined, because I don't know how to do this.  Too many
     problems.
**** DECLINED Rewrite the `format' function
     To make narrowing work under XEmacs, I would need to write a
     version of /format/ that does transport text properties, or I
     would have to rework narrowing entirely.  Unlikely that this will
     happen, mainly because it is working in Emacs and so does not
     bother me personally so much.  Anyway, I don't know if people are
     actually using narrowing very much at all.


** Exporting
*** IDEA Convert links to footnotes for ASCII export.
*** DECLINED Store LaTeX code as HTML comments
    Declined because I don't really see the need for this.
*** IDEA Microformats
    Nic Ferrier has been pushing this agenda for a long time, for
    example with [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/140/][this email]].  I am not deep enough into the semantic
    web that I could do this myself.  Maybe we can do this by
    modifying the html exporter step-by-step?
*** INCONSISTENCY Find a better place for formatting checkboxes
    Right now this is being done as part of `org-html-expand', which
    does not seem logically correct.
*** DECLINED Can I make the exporter more efficient?
    The line-by-line processing may not be the fastest way to do
    this.  It certainly uses more resources.  Right now the exporters
    do work though, so it is unlikely that I am going to change this.

*** DECLINED CSV import/export of tables?
    I remember this coming up several times, for example in emails
    from [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/156][Niels Giesen]] and [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/139][Tim Callaghan]].  Org-mode does have
    Tab-separated export of tables, so right now I don't really see
    the benefit of adding CSV export.  Are there applications that do
    not understand tab-separated files, but do understand
    comma-separated ones?

*** DECLINED In HTML export, make links from the time stamps
    Time stamps have their own class now which allows to highlight
    them etc.  But I was wondering if something more useful could be
    done with them, like a link to some kind of calendar...



** Miscellaneous Stuff
*** TODO reinstating a repeated item: keyword for logging.
*** BUG Comments cannot be filled
*** IDEA New uses for C-c C-c
    - Compute time interval on time range
    - Update CLOCK interval
*** QUESTION Fix more beginning-of-line commands
    Org-mode re-binds C-a to make this command go to the beginning of
    a visible line.  There are other keys which might invoke C-a.
    Should these keys be changed as well?  one could use
    `substitute-key-definition' on the global map to find them all.
*** QUESTION Inlining of images in Org-mode files
*** TODO Fixup outline-magic.el, so that it can be used.
*** TODO Use the new argument of bibtex-url
    Roland Winkler was kind enough to implement a new argument to the
    `bibtex-url' command that allows me to retrieve the corresponding
    URL, whether it is taken from a URL field or constructed in some
    clever way.  Currently I am not using this, because too many
    people use an old Emacs version which does not have this.
    however, eventually I will implement this.
*** WISH Get people to write articles about how to do GTD with Org-mode.
    There is now one by Charles Cave, read it [[http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/orgmode.html][here]]

*** IDEA Tree statistics
    A key that can be applied to a tree, showing statistics:
    - how many headlines
    - how many TODO
    - how many DONE
    - Checkboxes
    - etc....

*** QUESTION Do we need a 43 folders implementation?
    That could easily be done in an org-mode file.  But then, maybe
    this should really be a paper thing. 

*** Priorities
    Here is some information about priorities, which is not yet
    documented.
**** QUOTE Priorities
    TODO entries: 1 or 1,2,...
    DEADLINE is 10-ddays, i.e. it is 10 on the due day
                          i.e. it goes above top todo stuff 7 days
                               before due
    SCHEDULED is 5-ddays, i.e. it is 5 on the due date
                          i.e. it goes above top todo on the due day
    TIMESTAMP is 0        i.e. always at bottom
                          but as a deadline it is 100
                          but if scheduled it is 99
    TIMERANGE is 0        i.e. always at bottom
    DIARY is 0            i.e. always at bottom

    Priority * 1000

*** INCONSISTENCY: items don't grow/shrink due to promotion.
    In plain lists, multiple demote/promote commands executed directly
    after each other don't change the scope of the command - the
    initially selected text continues to be selected.  This is
    inconsistent with the behavior of outline sections, were the subtree
    for promotion/demotion is newly defined after each command.  Which
    convention is better?  Should this be consistent between trees and
    plain lists?

*** INCONSISTENCY: M-TAB does not work on plain lists.  Why???

*** QUESTION grep on directory does not yet work.
    I am actually not sure, I might have addressed this already, but
    my memory is failing me.  Needs some checking.

*** DECLINED HAVE a TIME 3:55 line collecting CLOCK results
    The CLOCK lines could be there in addition, or could even be
    removed, so that only one line is kept.
*** DECLINED Think about Piotr's idea of treating TODO like a TAG.
    The answer is probably NO because the simple part of TODO must
    still be there and I like the keyword at the beginning of the line,
    just like a checkbox.  Of course you can make a TODO tag yourself
    at any time.

*** DECLINED Inlining of external files

*** DECLINED Should TAB on TODO keyword rotate its state?
    Problem:  If the keyword disappears, it will suddenly start to fold....
    So my feeling right now is that the answer should be NO.

    No, because S-left/right does this already pretty well

*** DECLINED Create a DONE counter in the mode line
    That counter shows what faction of entries has been marked DONE.  I
    am not yet sure how useful such a thing would be, because of the
    huge number of entries that can be in a file, and the different
    weight of such entries.
    Declined because we do now have counters for checkboxes, and the
    feeling is that this is not so useful for TODOs.

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:17>) Document that font-lock-mode is needed

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:17>) Add keyboard access and menu commands for org-project.el
    C-c C-x C-p or something like that.
    In the menu, it goes under export, or even its own group.

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:17>) Document those new keys in orgcard.tex
    C-c C-x C-p or something like that.
    In the menu, it goes under export, or even its own group.

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:17>) Remove SCHEDULED keyword when marking it done.
    in particular when adding a CLOSED timestamp.
    Only problem is that when unclosing it, it should be scheduled
    again

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:17>) Don't show tasks already scheduled for the future, only stuff which
    is not yet scheduled.

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:17>) Put title and tags in separate classes

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:17>) Option to leave out TAGS from export

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:17>) Option to leave out Timestamps from export

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:17>) Checkable items like Frank Ruell's proposal

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:17>) Classify Keywords and time stamps
    <span class="keyword">SCHEDULED: </span><span
    class="timestamp">timestamp goes here</span><br>

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:17>) Change default for include-all-todo to nil

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:17>) Specify TAGS in a special line instead of collecting them dynamically
    The could help to avoid typos and could be faster for very large files.

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:17>) Some much faster interface for setting tags.
    Basically, use single keys to add/remove tags from the list.  Also
    for this the idea to define tags in a special line would be good,
    in order to have a way to define the shortcuts. 

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:17>) Remove date stamps from headline if they are not needed.
    Bug report from Scott.


*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:17>) : Maybe s-up/down should change priorities only in headlines
    Right now this works wherever the cursor is.  If this is changed,
    should S-up or S-down do something else?  

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:21>) Need a command to remove tabulators from a line.
    Use this in ASCII export, to make sure we get the indentation
    right.

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 09:24>) Improve tab in org-cycle:
    - there is a bug when the setting is 'white:  It requires a
      non-empty white line!
    - There should be another setting to have tab be the tabulator in
      the white space at the beginning of the line.
    - Finally, when TAB closes an entry, maybe it should go beck to the
      beginning of the entry???  On the other hand, it is good to be
      able to go back to the old place with just another tab.

*** DONE(<2006-06-01 Thu 11:48>) Include TAGS into sorting.
    But what strategy should be used when there are several tags?

*** DONE(<2006-06-06 Tue 10:15>) Archiving an entry in current buffer goes to end of file
    Should go to end of subtree.
    This is done now, and I also control the amount of empty lines
    created by the archiving process in general.

*** DONE(<2006-06-06 Tue 10:16>) Narrowing agenda to current files does not work as advertized.
    C-c a 1 t should make the TODO list for the current file, but does
    not.

*** DONE(<2006-06-06 Tue 10:17>) Radio TAGS for the fast tag interface.
    Make lists of tags that are mutually exclusive.  So when I turn on
    @HOME, @WORK would be turned off automagically.  A good syntax for
    defining these groups in the #+TAGS line would be:
    : #+TAGS: [@WORK(w) @HOME(h) @CLUB(c)] Laptop(l) PC(p) Car(r)
    This could indicate that @WORK, @HOME, @CLUB are mutually exclusive.

    If I do this, I will also need a syntax for the global alist to
    indicate the same thing.

    It seems to me that with such grouping of tags, sorting would be
    useful as it would improve the overview over the current tags.  I
    might even be able to support mutually exclusive tags with
    fontification in the interface.  Or arrange things such that the
    mutually exclusive ones are all in the same row or column, to
    optimize the visual feedback.

    For the internal format, I think best would be something like

    : '( (:startgroup) ("@work") ("@home") ("@club") (:endgroup)
    :    ("Laptop") ("PC") ("Car"))
    This setup makes sure that assoc and rassoc still do work as
    expected.

*** DONE(<2006-06-06 Tue 10:17>) Should tags be sorted in a certain way?
    Right now, you can either set the tag sequence yourself through
    the completion interface.  If you use the fast tag selection
    interface, the tag sequence depends on the order in which tags are
    selected and deselected.  maybe a specific roder would be useful
    for example the same order as the one given in the configuration?

*** DONE(<2006-06-06 Tue 10:17>) Remove narrowing cookies for export
    Exported tables should not show narrowing cookies.  In fact, if a
    table line does contain nothing but narrowing cookies, the entire
    line should be removed.

*** DONE(<2006-06-11 Sun 07:32>) Track working times similar to time-clock.el
    This was proposed by David O'Toole in an
    [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/387][email to emacs-orgmode@gnu.org]].  He wants to be able to know the
    times when he worked at a particular project.  Some reporting
    possibility would be needed to make this useful.  Maybe sparse
    trees with broken-down working times?

*** DONE(<2006-06-15 Thu 13:35>) Make org-store-link do better in image-mode buffers
    Just link to the file.

*** DONE(<2006-06-15 Thu 13:35>) Use a ported version of noutline.el
    Programming the old outline-mode is really a nightmare - the new
    outline mode that uses invisibility properties instead of
    selective display works really much much better.  There is now
    an [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/214/focus=218][experimental port]] by Greg Chernov, so when I find time I will
    try if this works well.  If yes, this port should become part of
    XEmacs.  Once that happens, I could remove a large amount of
    ballast from org.el

*** DONE(<2006-06-15 Thu 13:35>) Verify links during export

*** DONE(<2006-09-25 Mon 16:11>) Allow counting checkboxes
    Then some statistics should be displayed.  One idea is for
    checkboxes, to use a special box [%] which will be updated with
    percent of done.  I could have an alternative [/] that will be
    updated with something like [19/25] to show progress, and when the
    two numbers are equal, I could highlight then in DONE face, just
    like [100%].  All smaller numbers could be highlighted even in
    TODO face if I wanted.  Hmmm, I am beginning to like this.

    Then: how to update this?  Each time a checkbox is added or
    toggled, go up and update all the counts, right up to something
    which is not an item, or up to the previous header line.

    Maybe I should also make an option for turning this on, to avoid
    slowdown.  I guess for long lists this could be slow.

    Also would need a command for global update.

    An maybe plain list and checkboxes should get their own chapter?
    In Structure they seem to be a bit hidden.....

    Also a menu sublist...

*** DONE(<2006-09-25 Mon 16:11>) Allow stacking calls to org-occur
    This was a proposal from Piotr.  It is now possible, the second
    and subsequent calls to org-occur need a prefix argument to keep
    the previous highlights.

*** DONE(<2006-09-25 Mon 16:12>) Create a hook to be run after an agenda buffer has been finalized.

*** DONE(<2006-09-25 Mon 16:12>) Include TAGS into sorting.
    But what strategy should be used when there are several tags?

*** DONE(<2006-09-25 Mon 16:12>) Fixup tag display in agenda buffer.
    The tabs mess up everything.  Either remove the tabs, or realign
    the tags to some useful column.

*** DONE(<2006-09-25 Mon 16:12>) Blocks in agenda:
    Make a single agenda buffer that contains several sets of items,
    like the TODO list, a tags list, and a day view.  Not a bad idea.
    This was [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/167/focus=168][Piotr's idea]].

*** DONE(<2006-09-25 Mon 16:12>) Make org-store-link do the right thing in dired-mode

*** DONE([2006-11-02 Thu 10:24]) Control over windows being used for agenda and related buffers :NEW:

*** DONE([2007-01-24 Wed 12:59]) Extend access to table fields
    Find a general way to get any rectangular region into a calc
    vector

*** DONE([2007-01-24 Wed 12:59]) Allow links to remote images to be inlined.

*** DONE([2007-01-24 Wed 12:59]) M-TAB on an already complete tag should add the ":"

*** DONE([2007-01-24 Wed 13:07]) Need a command to do show hierarchy after isearch.
    Maybe automatically, using isearch-mode-end-hook.  But this does
    not seem to work, because to is called before the overlays are
    re-installed.  I can create a new hook, isearch-exit-hook, run in
    `isearch-exit'.

*** DONE([2007-02-18 Sun 07:16]) hook for users to do their own agenda lists
    New function dumping headline into the agenda buffer, based on regexp
    and callback, to allow general stuff.  For the special tags, we can
    search for one and check for the others using the callback.

*** DONE([2007-02-18 Sun 07:37]) Make C-c C-l also work on a plain link, converting it into bracket.

*** DONE([2007-02-18 Sun 07:37]) GNUS gnus:mail.general#123 stuff should be "Email from:..."

*** DONE([2007-02-18 Sun 07:38]) Email/message context:  What format?
    I can think of two good formats for this:
    : Email from John Smith   (if I an the receiver)
    : Email to John Smith     (if I am the author)
    or
    : John Smith on: Some subject     (this is the current Org-mode default.)
    The first format requires better parsing of the messages (to get
    both author and receiver names), and also
    some way to detect if I am the author of this email or not.

*** DONE([2007-02-21 Wed 12:04]) Allow internal links to match inside *other* link
    Only the link itself that actually triggered the search.

*** DONE([2007-02-21 Wed 12:07]) Allow fully protected HTML code that will be exported as is
    Currently, @<...> works only for simple tags, and I think we
    should have something better.  Idea:  Text between <protecthtml>
    and </protecthtml>, mark it with a text property and then exclude
    each match in the run preparing the export.
    I guess I could require these at the beginning of the line, like

#+PROTECT

#+ENDPROECT

    or something like that.......

*** DONE([2007-03-13 Tue 05:19]) Make it possible to set TOC levels independently of headline levels
    The easiest way to do this would obviously be to allow a number
    setting for the tco switch, not only a simple t/nil switch.  This
    can be nice for webpages:  One could have only top-level or level
    1 and 2 in the toc at the beginning of the page, and then still a
    more complex structure below.

*** DONE([2007-03-13 Tue 05:20]) Filling is not done in a compatible way.
    The current setup used the Emacs variables and machine to get the
    filling of plain lists and everything lese right.  XEmacs uses the
    filladapt package, which has different ways to do the same
    things.  org.el should be smart about this and setup filling under
    XEmacs correctly.

*** DONE([2007-06-06 Wed 17:44]) Repeating Schedules?
    [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/149][Dieter Grollman]] requested this feature, but for now I have decided
    not to do anything about it.  I don't see a good way to implement
    this, and I believe that cyclic diary entries are good enough for
    such tasks.

*** DONE([2007-06-14 Thu 13:16]) improve item indentation when promoting and demoting

*** DONE([2007-06-14 Thu 13:17]) The TODO buffer lists possible TODO keywords
    These are taken from the current buffer, so when multiple buffers
    are involved, this list may not be correct.....

*** DONE([2007-06-14 Thu 13:20]) Conflict between bold emphasis and headlines
    At the beginning of a line, Org-mode does not know if *bold* is a
    headline or an emphasis.  This will not be easy to fix.  The way
    to do ii is to require a space after the star in headlines.  This
    requires to change outline-regexp, outline-level, the many many
    times when outline regexp is used in the program, and also the
    countless times when I am simply matching th stars directly.

*** DONE C-c - for cycling bullet types.
    ARCHIVED: <2007-07-02 Mon>

*** DONE improve what TAB does with new item
    ARCHIVED: <2007-07-02 Mon>
    same or additional indentation????

*** DONE Make it easier to do monthly agendas, and agendas for ranges
    ARCHIVED: <2007-07-02 Mon>

*** DONE Introduce a LOCATION keyword
    ARCHIVED: <2007-07-02 Mon>
    similar to DEADLINE and SCHEDULED
    Idea from Bastien
    This could be done now using properties, I don't think we need a
    special thing for this anymore.

*** DONE Times/date not always removed in agenda lines
    ARCHIVED: <2007-07-02 Mon>
    Even when org-agenda-remove-times-when-in-prefix is set, there
    seem to be cases where this does not work.  I forgot what the
    example was - does anyone remember?

*** DONE Links are still highlighted in fixed-width environments.
    ARCHIVED: <2007-07-02 Mon>
    This ties in with the problem that there is no way to have
    protected HTML code in the file.
