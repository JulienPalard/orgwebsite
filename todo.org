#+TITLE:     The Org-mode TODO list

* Introduction

This is a loose collection of ideas and TODO items for the future
development of Org-mode.  These ideas come from various sources,
mostly from emacs-orgmode@gnu.org, from direct emails to me, or from
my own day-dreaming.  I don't always mention the source of an idea,
out of laziness.  However, when I implement a good idea, I try to
mention the origin of this idea in the /Acknowledgments/ section of
the manual - let me know if I forgot to give /you/ credit for
something.

** Nomenclature
   On this page, I am using TODO keywords in the following way:
   |-----------------+----------------------------------------------------|
   | *Keyword*       | Intention                                          |
   |-----------------+----------------------------------------------------|
   | *TODO*          | A development  that is going to happen, once I have time or once I figure out how to do it. |
   | *IDEA*          | A new idea, I have not yet decided what if anything I will do about it. |
   | *WISH*          | A wish, probably voiced by someone on  emacs-orgmode@gnu.org.  This is less than a new idea, more a change in existing behavior. |
   | *QUESTION*      | A question someone asked, that needs some thinking before it can be answered |
   | *DECLINED*      | I have decided not to implement this feature, but I am keeping it in the list so that people can see it, complain, or still try to convince me. |
   | *INCONSISTENCY* | Some behavior in Org-mode that is not as clean and consistent as I would like it to be. |
   | *BUG*           | This needs to be fixed, as soon as possible.       |
   | *DONE*          | Well, done is done.                                |
   | /NEW/           | This is a tag, indicating recently added entries   |
   |                 | <50>                                               |
   |-----------------+----------------------------------------------------|

   
* Tasks

** Structure
*** TODO Definition lists, like in Muse
*** TODO Get rid of all the \r instances, which were used only for XEmacs.
*** TODO proper visibility cycling for items
    Make them not hide the text after the final list item.
    This is not trivial, we cannot usenormal outline stuff,
    needs a separate implementaiton.
*** WISH Inline TODO entries
    A way to put a TODO entry without starting a new section.

** Agenda issues
*** WISH Make more modes changeable from the agenda
    These could be made available for toggling, just like
    follow-mode. Examples:
    - org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels
    - org-tags-match-list-sublevels
    - org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled
*** IDEA Sort TODO entries according to type?
    This would apply for the list collection, not in the day entries.
    However, I could also have a TODO keyword criterion that could be
    used in the day entries, as one of the minor criteria.

** Links
*** WISH Variable of standard links for completion with C-c C-l
    Or something like that, to make standard links fast.
*** IDEA Find all links to a specific file
*** IDEA Make info HTML links work for links to Info files
    Info links of course only work inside Emacs.  However, many info
    documents are on the web, so the HTML exporter could try to be
    smart and convert an Info link into the corresponding link on the
    web.  For example, we could use the GNU software site then
    Name.HTML.  Here is the link to be used:
    http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ Another
    question is, is this URL going to be stable so that it makes sense
    to actually put this into org.el?

*** IDEA Make news HTML links work, using Google.
    I can use Google groups with a message id to find a USENET message,
    even if the original link points to gnus.

*** TODO Remove irretrievable links from /published/ HTML output
    This is on David's table, and he will hopefully integrate a
    mechanism for this into org-publish.el.  The discussion about this
    was started by [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/281][Austin Frank]]

*** TODO Document the character protection in links
    I don't think this is really covered anywhere.
    Maybe we also should protect characters in the visible part, to
    make sure thing will never be on two lines...?

*** WISH Radio targets across files
    I guess each org file could write a .orgtargets.filename file, if
    it has any radio targets.

** Tables

*** WISH Row formulas
    @4=.....

*** TODO Write a tutorial
    Demonstrate running averages.

*** WISH Make a variable that current line should be recomputed always
   in each table, skipping headers of course.

*** WISH Interactive way to get a converted table?

*** BUG When computing in a narrowed column, this may go wrong.
    Computing changes fields and does not yet see correctly if the column
    width has changed, in the case of a narrowed column.

** Compatibility issues
*** Emacs 21 compatibility
    This is being phased out.  Almost everything works under Emacs 21,
    but in the future I will make little effort to support it.
**** DECLINED Column view does not yet work for Emacs 21s.
     Declined, because I don't know how to do this.  Too many
     problems.
*** XEmacs compatibility
**** QUESTION Is there an issue with the coding system of HTML exported files?
     In the code I used to have a comment saying that
     :  (and (fboundp 'coding-system-get)
     :       (boundp 'buffer-file-coding-system)
     :                 buffer-file-coding-system))
     always returns nil, implicating that setting the coding system for
     the export buffer would not work correctly.  however, I have never
     followed up on this and never had a bug report - so I am wondering
     if there is an issue at all.
  
**** DECLINED Column view does not yet work for XEmacs.
     Declined, because I don't know how to do this.  Too many
     problems.
**** DECLINED Rewrite the `format' function
     To make narrowing work under XEmacs, I would need to write a
     version of /format/ that does transport text properties, or I
     would have to rework narrowing entirely.  Unlikely that this will
     happen, mainly because it is working in Emacs and so does not
     bother me personally so much.  Anyway, I don't know if people are
     actually using narrowing very much at all.


** Exporting
*** IDEA Convert links to footnotes for ASCII export.

*** INCONSISTENCY Find a better place for formatting checkboxes
    Right now this is being done as part of `org-html-expand', which
    does not seem logically correct.

** Miscellaneous Stuff
*** BUG Comments cannot be filled
*** QUESTION Inlining of images in Org-mode files
*** TODO Fixup outline-magic.el, so that it can be used.
*** TODO Use the new argument of bibtex-url
    Roland Winkler was kind enough to implement a new argument to the
    `bibtex-url' command that allows me to retrieve the corresponding
    URL, whether it is taken from a URL field or constructed in some
    clever way.  Currently I am not using this, because too many
    people use an old Emacs version which does not have this.
    however, eventually I will implement this.

*** QUESTION Do we need a 43 folders implementation?
    That could easily be done in an org-mode file.  But then, maybe
    this should really be a paper thing. 

*** Priorities
    Here is some information about priorities, which is not yet
    documented.
**** QUOTE Priorities
    TODO entries: 1 or 1,2,...
    DEADLINE is 10-ddays, i.e. it is 10 on the due day
                          i.e. it goes above top todo stuff 7 days
                               before due
    SCHEDULED is 5-ddays, i.e. it is 5 on the due date
                          i.e. it goes above top todo on the due day
    TIMESTAMP is 0        i.e. always at bottom
                          but as a deadline it is 100
                          but if scheduled it is 99
    TIMERANGE is 0        i.e. always at bottom
    DIARY is 0            i.e. always at bottom

    Priority * 1000

*** INCONSISTENCY: items don't grow/shrink due to promotion.
    In plain lists, multiple demote/promote commands executed directly
    after each other don't change the scope of the command - the
    initially selected text continues to be selected.  This is
    inconsistent with the behavior of outline sections, were the subtree
    for promotion/demotion is newly defined after each command.  Which
    convention is better?  Should this be consistent between trees and
    plain lists?

*** INCONSISTENCY: M-TAB does not work on plain lists.  Why???

*** QUESTION grep on directory does not yet work.
    I am actually not sure, I might have addressed this already, but
    my memory is failing me.  Needs some checking.

*** DECLINED Inlining of external files
