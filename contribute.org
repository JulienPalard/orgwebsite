No matter your level of experience with Org/Emacs/elisp there are ways you can
get in contact with [[mailto:emacs-orgmode@gnu.org][emacs-orgmode@gnu.org]] to help push this project forward!
- very little experience :: give feedback on your experience with org
- a dash of experience :: help improve the documentation
- some experience :: help test patches, track down bugs
- moderate experience :: submit bug-fixes, improve features

Just do whatever you feel comfortable with, I guarantee it will be appreciated.

* The mailing list
This is where everything happens. You can [[https://orgmode.org/list/][browse]] previous email, or even better
[[https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-orgmode][subscribe to the mailing list]] to stay in tune with the latest discussions.

* Copyright issues
Org is constituted by many files, most of which are distributed as part of GNU
Emacs. These are called the /Org core/, and are copyrighted by the [[http://www.fsf.org/][Free Software
Foundation]] (FSF).

If you'd like to contribute to these files, you'll [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html][need]] to grant the FSF the
right to include your files in GNU Emacs. To do this one simply needs to fill
out [[https://orgmode.org/request-assign-future.txt][this form]], and email it to [[mailto:assign@gnu.org][assign@gnu.org]].

* Patch conventions
** Suggested workflow
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
~$ git pull
~$ git branch my-changes
~$ git checkout my-changed
# make some changes
~$ git commit -a -m "Definately following the commit conventions"
# repeat a few times, as appropriate
~$ git format-patch master
# optional, see: https://git-send-email.io/
~$ git send-email --to="emacs-orgmode@gnu.org" HEAD^
#+END_SRC
** Coding conventions
 Org is part of Emacs, so any contribution should follow the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Coding-Conventions.html][GNU Emacs Lisp coding conventions]] described in Emacs manual.
** Commit messages
We'd like commit messages to be structured like so,
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
main file/feature: overall change summary

,* file-changed.el (function-changed, another-function): Description of
the change implemented, reference any relevant `other-functions' or
`variables' here.
(another-changed-function): Change something.  Note the active voice,
avoid passive forms.  Also write in full sentences.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Written out more formally,
1. The first line should be the file/feature affected followed by a colon, and
   an short description of the overall change
2. The second line should be left blank
3. From the third line, there should be ChangeLog entry each file changed, as
   seen in the above example
   - Quote variables and function names like ~`this'~
   - Seperate sentences with *two* spaces
   - Use the active form over the passive form
4. Another empty line should follow
5. (optional) any supplementary information explaining the patch
6. If the change is made by a contributer /without/ FSF assignment, it can be
   accepted as long as it is 15 lines or less. In this case add the =TINYCHANGE=
   cookie (anywhere in the message)
** Sending patches
Use ~git diff~ or ~git format-patch~ to generate the patch files, then include them
in an email to [[mailto:emacs-orgmode@gnu.org][emacs-orgmode@gnu.org]] telling us about what you've done.
If you have git's [[https://git-send-email.io/][send-email]] set up, you can use that.

If you check [[https://orgmode.org/list/][the list]] and can't see your email after waiting at least 15
minutes, you may have a looked a little dodgy to the robot email overlords.
To get that email through [[https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-orgmode][subscribe]] to the lists, and it should work.

* Our beloved contributers
Over on /Worg/ we keep a [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contribute.html][list of contributors]] to Org's core.
