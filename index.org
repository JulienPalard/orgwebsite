* Org - an Emacs Mode for Notes and Project Planning

#+HTML:  <BASE href="http://orgmode.org/index.html">

Org-mode is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining ToDo lists, and doing
project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

Org-mode develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that contain
information about projects as plain text.  Org-mode is implemented on
top of outline-mode, which makes it possible to keep the content of
large files well structured.  Visibility cycling and structure editing
help to work with the tree.  Tables are easily created with a built-in
table editor.  Org-mode supports ToDo items, deadlines, time stamps,
and scheduling.  It dynamically compiles entries into an agenda.
Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails, Usenet
messages, BBDB entries, and any files related to the projects.  For
printing and sharing of notes, an Org-mode file can be exported as a
structured ASCII file, HTML, and LaTeX.

* Current Version (6.00pre-5) and Compatibility

The current version is 6.00pre-5.  To see what has changed in recent
releases, check this [[file:Changes.html][list of user-visible changes]].  These descriptions
are extensive, to avoid that people will be printing the manual after
each incremental release.  If you have an older version of the manual,
just check the release notes and you will be up-to-date.

This package works on Emacs 22, and (with minor restrictions) on Emacs
21 and XEmacs 21 (where you must also use /noutline.el/ shipped with
Org-mode).  The Emacs 22.1 release ships with Org-mode version 4.67c.
The latest CVS emacs trunk usually contains a fairly recent version,
but may lag a bit behind the website release.

* Downloads

**** Distribution

Download as [[file:org-5.23a.zip][zip file]] or [[file:org-5.23a.tar.gz][gzipped tar archive]].  These archives contain
both the Lisp file org.el and the documentation in PDF and (TeX)Info
formats.  A shell script to simplify upgrading to the newest release
has been posted [[http://www.philfam.co.uk/pete/GTD/org-mode/update-org.sh][here]].

**** Get the development version

You can check out the latest Org development version by using git.

* Documentation
** Manual and Reference card
   - Read the documentation [[file:manual/index.html][online]].  This is a version consisting of many
     small files, to save bandwidth.  If you really need it, you can also
     have the entire manual in a [[file:org.html][single monolithic file]].
   - Download the documentation in other formats: [[file:org.pdf][PDF]], [[file:org][Info]], or [[file:org.texi][TeXInfo]].
   - Download the [[file:orgcard.pdf][Refcard]] for org-mode, and Kyle Sherman hast created a
     [[file:orgcard.txt][text version]] of the reference card
   - There is also a [[http://hpcgi1.nifty.com/spen/index.cgi?OrgMode%2fManual][Japanese translation]] of the manual (version 4.60),
     produced by Takeshi Okano.
   - The [[file:faq.org][FAQ]] is not very up-to-date, but may still answer some of your
     questions.  Please have a look before posting to emacs-orgmode@gnu.org.

** Worg - user-driven knowledge-base about org-mode

[[http://www.legito.net/worg/][Worg]], created by [[http://www.cognition.ens.fr/~guerry/][Bastien Guerry]], is a setup to allow users to jointly
edit a number of Org-mode files containing documentation about Org-mode.
This is something like a wiki.  If you'd like to contribute your own
setup, screenshots, tutorials etc, please go to [[http://www.legito.net/worg/][the Worg page]], and start
from there.

** Tutorials

   [[http://www.legito.net/worg/org-tutorials/index.php][Tutorials and screencasts]] are maintained by the [[http://www.legito.net/worg][Worg project]].

** Survey

   In November 2007, Charles Cave organized a survey among Org-mode
   users.  The answers given in this survey can be found [[file:survey.html][here]].

** Org-mode, GTD and other task management systems 
    Org-mode is flexible enough to implement many different ways of
    organizing your projects.  A frequently discusses scheme is [[http://www.davidco.com/][David
    Allen's]] strategy for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTD][Getting Things Done]].  But it is clearly not
    the only way to us Org-mode for planning.  Here are a couple of
    links related to this topic.

    - [[http://johnwiegley.com][John Wiegley]] has written an excellent document describing his
      way of using Org-mode as a [[http://johnwiegley.com/org.mode.day.planner.html][day planner]]. See also some later
      messages for enhancements of his setup:
      [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/2963][emacs-orgmode-2962]], [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/3629][emacs-orgmode-3629]]

    - [[http://members.optusnet.com.au/charles57/Creative/][Charles Cave]] has written an [[http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/orgmode.html][article/tutorial]] about the basic
      elements of GTD and how he implements them in Org-mode.  There
      is also a [[http://www.legito.net/worg/org-tutorials/orgtutorial_dto-fr.php][french translation]] of this document.

    - There have been several threads on emacs-orgmode@gnu.org related
      to GTD, the most important ones are:

      + [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/683][Another GTD question]], which contains a discussion about basic
        GTD aspects.  It also contains this
      + [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/715][Post by Carsten]] summarizing several options for implementing
        GTD in org-mode.
      + [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/523][GTD, Projects and Next Actions in org-mode]] is a thread where
        several people describe their personal setup is 
      + The [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/4915][SOMEDAY/MAYBE vs. low priorities]] thread contains a
        discussion about priorities that is quite instructive.
      + Here is a [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/4832/focus%3D4854][very instructive post]] by Pete Phillips explaining
        why David Allens book is where you should start to learn GTD,
        and that the Internet and Org-mode only come into the game
        later, when thinking about the implementation.  And since
        doing GTD the right way will give you lots of free time, don't
        forget to listen to [[http://www.detox-jazz.co.uk/][Pete's music]]!

    - Also on the web you can find information about how people are
      setting up Org-mode to fit their habits.  A few examples:

      + This [[http://www.brool.com/?p=82][blog post]] shows a very simple and clear GTD setup.

** Add-Ons

   - [[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pz215/][Piotr Zielinski]] wrote [[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pz215/files/org-mouse.el][org-mouse.el]] which is now distributed with
     Org-mode. It implements great mouse support for many functions in
     org-mode.

   - [[http://dto.freeshell.org/notebook/][David O'Toole]] is the author of [[http://dto.freeshell.org/e/org-publish.el][org-publish.el]]. While this is
     now part of the Org-mode distribution, you might find the newest
     bug fixes and developments at his [[http://dto.freeshell.org/notebook/OrgMode.html][Org-mode page]], along with
     several other projects like /org-blog.el/ and
     /org-publish-escript.el/.

   - [[http://www.cognition.ens.fr/~guerry/][Bastien Guerry]] has been really prolific in writing interesting
     add-ons, all available at his [[http://www.cognition.ens.fr/~guerry/bastien-org-mode.html][org-mode page]]:
     + a package for using Org-mode as the basis for blogging
     + a LaTeX exporter that is now distributed together with
       org-mode
     + a special table-of-contents buffer that simplifies navigation
     + a registry to find locations that link a specific document.

   - George C.F. Greve wrote [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/org-mairix.el][org-mairix.el]] to add links that trigger a
     mairix search.

** Translators
   
   I know about the following attempts to translate from and to
   Org-mode files:

*** Org-mode to XXX

    - [[http://www.cognition.ens.fr/~guerry/u/org2rem.el][From Org-mode to remind]] by [[http://www.cognition.ens.fr/~guerry/][Bastien Guerry]].
      
    - [[file:org-export-freemind-0.1.0.tar.gz][From Org-mode to Freemind]] by Marco Vezzoli.

*** XXX to Org-mode

    - [[http://www.olafdietsche.de/palm/palm2orgmode.pl][From Palm TODO database to Orgmode]].  This Translator was
      written by [[http://www.olafdietsche.de/][Olaf Dietsche]].

    - From [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/5073][Remind to Org]] by Detlef Steuer.

*** Bi-directional
    
    Unfortunately nothing so far.

** Alternative distributions

   - Mark A. Hershberger has made some [[https://launchpad.net/~hexmode/+archive][Ubuntu packages]] for org-mode.

** Contributing to Org-mode

   You can always contribute with ideas and bug reports on the mailing
   list.  If you want to contribute a patch, code snippets, or a full
   add-on, this is very welcome too!  However, I can only make it an
   official part of Org-mode if you have signed the papers with the
   Free Software Foundation.  Org-mode is distributed as part of Emacs
   and must therefore adhere to strict rules about the copyright of
   all included material.  If this is what you want to do, [[file:request-assign-future.txt][here]] is the
   form that you have to fill in and send to the FSF.  After you
   received the final copy with signatures, please scan it and send
   the scan to the maintainer.

** Future Development

   Org-mode is still developing fast.  The best way to stay up-to-date
   is to join the mailing list where the changes are developed and
   discusssed.

   Here is a loose [[file:todo.org][list of ideas]] that are still to be processed
   somehow, when I get to it...
