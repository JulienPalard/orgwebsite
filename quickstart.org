* Getting started with Org-mode
Overwhelmed by the manual? You're not alone. There's a lot that Org-mode /can/ do
for you, but you don't need much to get started.

At the start of a file, it is common to set some of the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-Settings.html][export options]]
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+title: My file
,#+author: myself
#+END_SRC
* Headings
Lines starting with ~*~ are headings. A single ~*~ denotes 1st-level heading, ~**~
denotes a 2nd-level heading, etc.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Welcome to Org-mode
Overwhelmed by the manual? You're not alone. There's a lot that Org-mode /can/ do
for you, but you don't need much to get started.
,** Sub-heading
   Every extra ~*~ brings you to a lower heading level.
#+END_SRC

To make a header into a task, just start the heading with a task keyword like
~TODO~ or ~HOLD~.
* Text styles
With org, *bold* /italic/ and _underline_ are all nice and simple. ~code~ and =verbatim=
are also nice and easy. If you must, +strikethrough+ is also available.
_/*Combine*/_ these as you'd like.

* Lists
Start a list with any of: ~+~, ~-~, or ~*~ for un-ordered lists, and ~1.~, ~1)~, ~A.~, or ~A)~
for ordered lists. Nest and mix these as you'd like :)

#+BEGIN_SRC org
To buy:
1. Milk
2. Eggs
   - Organic
3. Cheese
   + Parmesan
   + Mozzarella
#+END_SRC

Lists can also contain checkboxes: ~[ ]~, ~[-]~, ~[X]~
#+BEGIN_SRC org
- [ ] do
- [-] the
- [X] thing
#+END_SRC
* Images
Just link to an image, and don't give a description. Seriously, that's it. \\

#+attr_html: :height 120px
[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Konigsberg_bridges.png]]
* Links
Just put a target in between two square brackets, like so: ~[[target]]~. Want to
add a description? Just add a ~[description]~ after the target, i.e.
~[[target][desc]]~.

Org can handle a variety of different types of targets, which you use by giving
~[target]~ as ~[type:target]~. When no ~type:~ is provided, org just searches for a
heading which matches ~target~.

A few examples:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[[https://orgmode.org][a nice website]]
[[file:~/Pictures/dank-meme.png]]
[[earlier heading][an earlier heading in the document]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

** More info
For more information, see the manual sections on [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Internal-Links.html][Internal Links]] and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/External-Links.html#External-Links][External Links]].
* Code blocks
To just have a monospace block,

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
monospace
,#+END_EXAMPLE
#+END_SRC

If you want syntax highlighting and execution try
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+BEGIN_SRC python
print("Hello world")
,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

** More info
You can do a /lot/ with source code in org, see the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-Source-Code.html][Manual]] for more information.
* Tables
It's just like this comparison of existing Literate programming / reproducible
research tools (taken from [[doi:10.18637/jss.v046.i03][this paper]]).
#+BEGIN_SRC org
